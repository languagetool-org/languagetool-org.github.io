# How to add a new Committer

This is our internal workflow documentation for how to add a new committer.

* if someone sends more than two good patches (no matter if code or 
  rules), offer them commit access
* add them as a team member on github
* ask them to follow the instructions on
  <http://dev.languagetool.org/tips-for-new-committers>  
* welcome them on the forum and twitter
* ask them to make a first commit, e.g. adding themselves as a 
  maintainer in <Language>.java, if appropriate
* ask if they want an email forwarder address (firstname.lastname@languagetool.org)
* ask them to set up watches at webtranslateit if they are going to work on translations

# Release Roadmap

In March 2025, [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) has switched to a snapshot-based release model.
This means that there will be no new ZIP files with a fixed version number `X.Y` anymore.
Instead, you can download the latest daily snapshot from
[https://languagetool.org/download/snapshots/](https://languagetool.org/download/snapshots/).
